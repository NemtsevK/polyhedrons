          <p class="types-item__text">Each solid on this page was created by applying the rectify operation to one of the Archimedean solids. Rectification is a form of truncation where each vertex is truncated up to the midpoints of the edges meeting at that vertex. This operation is typically applied to one of the Platonic solids, but it can also be applied to a non-regular polyhedron as long as the midpoints of the edges meeting at each vertex are coplanar. If the non-regular polyhedron is convex, then the resulting polyhedron will not intersect itself.</p>
