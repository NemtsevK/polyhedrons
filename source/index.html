          <p class="types-item__text">The five Platonic solids, also known as the five regular solids, were discovered in ancient times. Although each one was probably known prior to 500 BC, they are collectively named after the ancient Greek philosopher Plato (428-348 BC) who mentions them in his dialogue Timaeus, written circa 360 BC. Each Platonic solid uses the same regular polygon for each face, with the same number of faces meeting at each vertex. The five Platonic solids are the only convex polyhedra that meet these criteria.</p>

Two of them (the Small Stellated Dodecahedron and the Great Stellated Dodecahedron) were discovered by Johannes Kepler (1571-1630). The other two (the Great Dodecahedron and Great Icosahedron) were discovered by Louis Poinsot (1777-1859) and are the duals of the two Kepler solids. Like the Platonic solids, these solids are regular because each uses the same regular polygon or star polygon for each face, with the same number of faces meeting at each vertex.</p>

          <p class="types-item__text">The Archimedean solids are a set of 13 polyhedra described by Pappus of Alexandria around 340 AD, who attributed them to the ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes (287-212 BC). Archimedes' own writings on the subject have been lost. Examining these 13 solids, it can be seen that each is a convex polyhedron whose faces are regular polygons of two or more types that meet in the same pattern around each vertex. It can also be seen that each has polyhedral group (tetrahedral, octahedral, or icosahedral) rotational symmetry. These 13 solids are the only polyhedra possessing both of these traits.</p>

They are named after the Belgian mathematician Eugene Catalan (1814-1894) who first described the complete set in 1865. The Rhombic Dodecahedron and Rhombic Triacontahedron were described in 1611 by Johannes Kepler. Each Catalan solid has one type of face and a constant dihedral angle, and it possesses the same symmetry as its Archimedean dual.</p>

There are nine versi-regular polyhedra, all of which are self-intersecting. Eight of the nine have non-orientable surfaces (like that of a Klein Bottle or the Real Projective Plane). The only one with an orientable surface is the Octahemioctahedron. The Tetrahemihexahedron has an Euler characteristic of 1, making it topologically equivalent to the Real Projective Plane. The remaining eight have even numbered Euler characteristics. All nine were described in 1881 by Albert Badoureau.</p>

          <p class="types-item__text">A polyhedron is quasi-regular if it is vertex-transitive and edge-transitive but not face-transitive. In this context, transitivity means that for any two vertices (edges, faces) of the polyhedron, there exists a translation, rotation, and/or reflection that leaves the outward appearance of the polyhedron unchanged yet moves one vertex (edge, face) to the other. This definition implies that a quasi-regular polyhedron must have two kinds of regular faces, where each face of one type is surrounded on all sides by faces of the other type. There are only two quasi-regular polyhedra that are not self-intersecting, namely the Cuboctahedron and the Icosidodecahedron. When self-intersection is allowed, there are 14 other quasi-regular polyhedra. Nine have faces that pass through their centers and are often subcategorized as versi-regular polyhedra.

          <p class="types-item__text"> The Platonic solids, Archimedean solids, and the regular prisms and antiprisms are vertex-transitive convex polyhedra with regular polygon faces. Vertex transitivity means that for any two vertices of the polyhedron, there exists a translation, rotation, and/or reflection that leaves the outward appearance of the polyhedron unchanged yet moves one vertex to the other. What happens if the vertex transitivity criterion is removed? As it turns out, there are 92 non-vertex-transitive convex polyhedra with regular polygon faces. In 1966, Norman Johnson published a paper titled "Convex Polyhedra with Regular Faces" where he described in detail all 92 of these polyhedra. He introduced names for those that weren't named previously, and he mentions that there appear to be no more than 92 of them. These 92 polyhedra are currently known as the Johnson solids. In 1967, Viktor Zalgaller proved that there are no more than 92. </p>
