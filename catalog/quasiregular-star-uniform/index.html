          <p class="types-item__text">A versi-regular polyhedron is a quasi-regular polyhedron distinguished by having faces that pass through its center. There are nine versi-regular polyhedra, all of which are self-intersecting. Eight of the nine have non-orientable surfaces (like that of a Klein Bottle or the Real Projective Plane). The only one with an orientable surface is the Octahemioctahedron. The Tetrahemihexahedron has an Euler characteristic of 1, making it topologically equivalent to the Real Projective Plane. The remaining eight have even numbered Euler characteristics. All nine were described in 1881 by Albert Badoureau.</p>

          <p class="types-item__text">A polyhedron is quasi-regular if it is vertex-transitive and edge-transitive but not face-transitive. In this context, transitivity means that for any two vertices (edges, faces) of the polyhedron, there exists a translation, rotation, and/or reflection that leaves the outward appearance of the polyhedron unchanged yet moves one vertex (edge, face) to the other. This definition implies that a quasi-regular polyhedron must have two kinds of regular faces, where each face of one type is surrounded on all sides by faces of the other type. There are only two quasi-regular polyhedra that are not self-intersecting, namely the Cuboctahedron and the Icosidodecahedron. When self-intersection is allowed, there are 14 other quasi-regular polyhedra. Nine have faces that pass through their centers and are often subcategorized as versi-regular polyhedra. The remaining five are listed on this page.</p>

In this context, transitivity means that for any two faces (edges, vertices) of the polyhedron, there exists a translation, rotation, and/or reflection that leaves the outward appearance of the polyhedron unchanged yet moves one face (edge, vertex) to the other. This definition implies that a quasi-regular dual must have two kinds of regular vertices, where each vertex of one type is connected along all of its edges to vertices of the other type. There are only two quasi-regular duals that are not self-intersecting, namely the Rhombic Dodecahedron and the Rhombic Triacontahedron. When self-intersection is allowed, there are 14 other quasi-regular duals, but only five of these are finite. The nine versi-regular polyhedra, due to their faces that pass through their centers, produce duals with vertices at infinity.</p>
